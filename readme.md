## Introduction

A `data structure` is used to denote a particular way of organizing data for particular types of operation.

An `algorithm` for a particular task can be defined as “a finite sequence of instructions, each of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite length of time”

### Arrays

In computer science, the obvious way to store an ordered collection of items is as an array where array items are typically stored in a sequence of computer memory locations.

```
var a = [23,4,556,231,5646,88,35]

console.log(a.length) -> 7
console.log(a[0]) -> 23
```

The element in the 7th position is 35, and we use the notation `a[7]` to denote this element; therefore, for any integer i denoting a position, we write `a[i]` to denote the element in the i th position. This position i is called an index.

**NB: In most modern programming languages, = denotes assignment, while
equality is expressed by ==**
