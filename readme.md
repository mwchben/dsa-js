An 'algorithm' for a particular task can be defined as “a finite sequence of instructions, each
of which has a clear meaning and can be performed with a finite amount of effort in a finite
length of time”
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
